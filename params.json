I currently work for Recondo Technology located in Greenwood Village, CO, where my job is Software Testing. \r\n\r\nI have a lovely girlfriend named Sabrina, and I have a cat named Athena. I like to snowboard, slackline, teach others, and most of all Ruby. I'm currently taking several courses on edX, Coursera, and Udacity while taking classes here at CSM. \r\n\r\nI've got a ton of things I've worked on and even though a lot of them are private you can still view the remaining ones at my github profile. @snowe2010\r\n\r\nYou can also see some of the problems I've encountered over at ajourneyinerrors.nfshost.com if you're interested. I have a hard time keeping it updated though, probably because I suck at css so it discourages me from actually writing anything that would get people to actually visit my page. \r\n\r\n“I'd far rather be happy than right any day.” \r\n― Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
