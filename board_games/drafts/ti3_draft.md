We began our adventure into the world of Twilight Imperium upon the night of 24 of January 2014. 
It began with the races of Sardakk N'orr, the L1Z1X Mindnet, Universities of Jol Nar, the Naalu Collective, the Emirates of Hacan, and the Barony of Letnev. 

In the beginning, all was peaceful in the galaxy. Each species set out to explore the nearby sectors hoping to strike it rich in resources and influence.
