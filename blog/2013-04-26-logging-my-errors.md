This is the story of my life. The problems I've come across and the solutions I've used to solve them. Not just compile time errors, or problems debugging, but the relationships in my life also. This is a manifesto of the reasons I chose to do specific things, why I am the way I am, and how I deal with those around me. This is my life.
