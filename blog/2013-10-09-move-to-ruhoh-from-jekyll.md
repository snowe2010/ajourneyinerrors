### Ruhoh, a better Jekyll

I've begun a move over to the Ruhoh platform. One of the main reasons for this is because I absolutely hate the Liquid Templating system used by Jekyll. 
Ruhoh uses Moustache which seems to be a much nicer choice overall. Also Ruhoh separates everything nice and neat like. 

- Content
- Views
- Presentation

So I don't need to worry about my presentation until I've actually gotten content. 
Another great this is that handling folders and links is a thousand times easier in Ruhoh. 

Hopefully this platform goes better than Jekyll. If not I don't know what I'll do.
