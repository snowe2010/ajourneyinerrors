<p>I was born in Texas. I grew up in Waco. I now live in Colorado, where I'm a student at the Colorado School of Mines. I currently work for Recondo Technology located in Greenwood Village, CO, where my job is Software Testing. </p>

<p>I have a lovely girlfriend named Sabrina, and I have a cat named Athena. I like to snowboard, slackline, teach others, and most of all Ruby. I'm currently taking several courses on edX, Coursera, and Udacity while taking classes here at CSM. </p>

<p>I've got a ton of things I've worked on and even though a lot of them are private you can still view the remaining ones at my github profile. <a href="https://github.com/snowe2010" class="user-mention">@snowe2010</a></p>

<p>You can also see some of the problems I've encountered over at ajourneyinerrors.nfshost.com if you're interested. I have a hard time keeping it updated though, probably because I suck at css so it discourages me from actually writing anything that would get people to actually visit my page. </p>
